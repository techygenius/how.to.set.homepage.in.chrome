1. Open Chrome on your system and click on the three dots â‹® visible on the top right-most corner.
2. Select "Settings" from the drop-down menu. Under Settings, select "Appearance."

3. Under the Appearance option, slide on the switch button corresponding to the "Show Home button" option. The button turns blue from gray.

4. Once the switch is turned on, you get to choose from two options.

    * New Tab page
    * Enter a custom web address

Choosing the first option would always open a new tab page whenever Chrome is launched. By choosing the second option, one can specify the webpage/website they want to see as the homepage.

This process helps you to determine the homepage for your chrome browser. However a Homepage differs from a Startup Page. The homepage is the page redirected to when the "Home button" is clicked. A Startup page, on the other hand, as the name suggests, is the first page that appears when the browser is launched.
